# Basics of JAVA

In this Repo, I have provided an Overview over to the Basics of the JAVA Programming Language. And each topic is been covered together with its code explanation in the Java Files that are mentioned above. For Covering up each part the syntax will also be available.

## About JAVA

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.

### Features of JAVA

- Platform Independent
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Secure
- Portable Code
- Multithreading
- Compilation and Interpretation

### Java Setup : 

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/SQykK40fFds?si=lB66ZemBoFafi16G)
- [Text Explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-java-for-64-bit-machine/?ref=lbp)

## Basic Syntax

Source Code :

```
class Class_name{
    public static void main(String[] a){
        System.out.println("Hello World !");
    }
}
```

- Note : Preferred to name the file as same name of the Class name containing main function.

For running the Code [Window] :

```bash
javac file_name.java
java file_name
```

Code Output : 

```bash
Hello World !
```

### Code Elements :

Below we have the explanation regarding the key elements in the above syntax :- 

- class : This keyword is used for declaring the class.
- public : It is type of access specifier, specifies that the class is available to all.
- static : static keyword is used to make the function static, and due to this we don't have to create any object for calling it.
- void : It is a return type which don't return anything to the main function.
- main() : This is the method from where the execution of the program starts from, without this we used to face compile error !
- String[] args : It specific that the user may opt to enter parameters to the JAVA Program. Both forms String[] args or String args[] are acceptable by the compiler.
- System.out.println : This is used to print anything on the console or the output screen.

## Data Types : 

### Primitive

- **Boolean** : Used to store the true (1) or false (0).
- **Byte** : This data type is useful in saving the memory space in case for working with large arrays.
- **Short** : This data type comes under the category of integer of 16 bit storage.
- **Int** : This data type is used for storing the numerical values within a particular limit.
- **Long** : This data type is used for storing the unsigned 64-bit numbers at a large storage limit.
- **Float** : This data type is used for storing the 32-bit decimal pointing integers in Source Code.
- **Double** : This data type is used for storing the double precision values in the Source code.
- **Char** : This data type is used for storing the character in any particular variable.

Note : Code is in the Basic.java file above in the Repo.

### Non-Primitive

- **String** : It is a kind of data type which is known from its other standard line, sequence of characters

Syntax Code : 

```
String str1 = "This is a simple string in JAVA";
```

- **Class** : It is a kind of user-defined data type in JAVA also in different programming languages which is created in order to create an entity or object in the main class [Source Code]

Syntax Code :

```
class Class_name{
    // class members
    public int number = 12;

    // class methods
    public void display(){
        System.out.println("Display Function here !");
    }
}
```

- **Object** : It is a kind of entity created in order to use the class here !

Syntax Code :

```
class First{

}

class Class_main{
    public static void main(String[] a){
        First obj1 = new First();
    }
}
```

- **Interface** : Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.

Syntax Code : 

```
interface interface_name{
    // inteface members
    // inteface methods but not defined
}
```

- **Arrays** : An Array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.

Syntax Code : 

```
datatype array_name = new datatype[length];
```
