## About JAVA

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.

### Features of JAVA

- Platform Independent
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Secure
- Portable Code
- Multithreading
- Compilation and Interpretation

### Java Setup : 

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/SQykK40fFds?si=lB66ZemBoFafi16G)
- [Text Explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-java-for-64-bit-machine/?ref=lbp)

## Basic Syntax

Source Code :

```
class Class_name{
    public static void main(String[] a){
        System.out.println("Hello World !");
    }
}
```

- Note : Preferred to name the file as same name of the Class name containing main function.

For running the Code [Window] :

```
javac file_name.java
java file_name
```

Code Output : 

```
Hello World !
```

### Code Elements :

Below we have the explanation regarding the key elements in the above syntax :- 

- class : This keyword is used for declaring the class.
- public : It is type of access specifier, specifies that the class is available to all.
- static : static keyword is used to make the function static, and due to this we don't have to create any object for calling it.
- void : It is a return type which don't return anything to the main function.
- main() : This is the method from where the execution of the program starts from, without this we used to face compile error !
- String[] args : It specific that the user may opt to enter parameters to the JAVA Program. Both forms String[] args or String args[] are acceptable by the compiler.
- System.out.println : This is used to print anything on the console or the output screen.
